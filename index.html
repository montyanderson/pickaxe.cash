				<h3>What is Pickaxe?</h3>

				<p>Pickaxe is a <i>proof-of-work minable ERC20 token</i>. This means that unlike classic tokens, coins aren't generated by and for the creator, they're generated by miners in the same way base currencies like Bitcoin are.</p>

				<p>However, unlike typical proof-of-work tokens, Pickaxe uses <i>proportional mining</i>.</p>
			</section>

				<h3>What is proportional mining?</h3>

				<p>Proportional mining is a system of token distribution that differs from the model found in Bitcoin and derivatives. Instead of all miners competing for a single block reward, miners are allowed to mine at any arbitrary difficulty they choose with reward being proportional.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h3>Why proportional mining?</h3>

				<p>Transaction fees on Ethereum can make small coins inefficient to mine - transaction fee can easily outweigh the value of a block's reward and small miners may never even hit a block.</p>
